## Hi there 👋 My name is Javiera V

----
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology ⚗️ from the **University of Concepción**, but my interests and skills extend well beyond my academic background. Over the years, I’ve explored diverse fields and built a multidisciplinary toolkit 🧰🔧.

In programming, my main language is Python🐍, and I have experience with Django, some frontend development, and SQL for backend. I also have experience with OSINT tools, through customized pipelines (rather than following the standard pipelines available online, I integrate unconventional sources that others often overlook)

I enjoy experimenting with prompt engineering and am currently expanding my knowledge in **machine learning**.
